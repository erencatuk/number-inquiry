# number-inquiry


I am here to share with you a project that I have been developing for weeks but have not yet published on the internet. Our website is based on a phone number lookup site. The entire content has been written by me. I wanted to share it with you before making the site available to users. You can make changes to the design and use it.The site was developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JS. MySQL has been preferred as the SQL server.
